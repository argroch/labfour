== Secrets Revealed!

So this is interesting. This was from before I was an instructor at TTS. I was just a lowly TA. And I held "labs"...every Thursday afternoon, wasn't it?

Well, I totally don't remember this one, but it's a pretty good intro example to using AJAX.

But it wasn't working properly. So I fixed it up. Updated the gems. It could use a styling polish, but, meh - I'm keeping it around for the back-end and JS stuff.

Neat find.
